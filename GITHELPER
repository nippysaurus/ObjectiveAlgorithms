I am new to GIT so this is to help me any anyone else who is in the same situation.

These are just command helpers for interacting with the github repo, not checking code into your local repo.

"PULL" changes from GitHub: git pull origin master

"Push" changes to GitHub: git push origin master

"Clone" a repo from GitHub: git clone <url from project page>

The url to clone can be found on the project page, and look something like this:

git@github.com:nippysaurus/ObjectiveAlgorithms.git
