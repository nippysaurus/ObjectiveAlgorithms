About
=====

ObjectiveAlgorithms is a personal project to implement various common algorithms using a combination of C (for speed) and Objective-C.

Since algorithms are usually better if they have been through some optimisation process I have developed some criteria to measure the quality of a particular algorithm. Please see the wiki for this criteria.

The code is an Xcode project which can be compiled into a console application (.app). The console application provides tester application which allow each algorithm to be tested.

Algorithms
==========

The following algorithms have been implemented so far:

 * Levenshtein Distance
 * Bubble Sort

Usage
=====

The xcode project will compile to a console application. Running the console application will present a menu to select an algorithm to test.
